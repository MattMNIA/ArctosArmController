- [ ] Ensure PyBullet simulation synchronizes with CAN driver actions:
    - When the CAN driver closes the gripper and encounters resistance (e.g., object prevents full closure), update the simulation to reflect the actual gripper position.
    - Implement feedback from CAN driver to PyBullet so simulation state matches real-world actuator limits and responses.
    - Add mirroring mode, where I can move it with the controller and record the movement so the arm can replicate it.
